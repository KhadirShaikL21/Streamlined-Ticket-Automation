üìÖ Day 2 Progress ‚Äì Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations
Overview

On Day 2, we successfully moved from the foundation phase (Users, Groups, Roles, Tables, ACLs) into automation and flow implementation. This was a critical milestone where we automated the process of assigning support tickets dynamically to the correct group based on the type of issue raised.

This step directly supports our project‚Äôs goal: reducing manual intervention and improving the speed of ticket resolution.
